# Corona-Cases
This was created as a project in part of the course Datenbanksysteme at the FU Berlin.

We were given a Dataset of Corona Cases and got the assignment to display them beautiful. This Website works with that data and displays a World Map with the countries colored in that have data. It also lets you zoom into countries to get their statistics as a pretty graph
